# E-Skate Remote based on Feather M0
### Still in Development! 
Designed off of the Firefly remote by SolidGeek, this version of the remote has implemented a couple of new features- namely:
- Redesigned Shell- Shorther shell fits nicer into the hand
- Assorted Design Changes- Bearings on the moving parts, PCB based connections, and more!
- Feather M0 Architecture- Reliable connection thanks to the Feather M0 board, also allows for VESC data as before!
- Optional "Advanced" Reciever- Control your board's lighting! Headlights, Adaptive Tail Lights, or Stylelights! Anything up to 24w can be powered and activated from your remote! 
- Haptic Feedback- Now your remote can provide a vibration to physically alert you to predefined conditions (such as low battery)
- E-STOP- With E-STOP, you'll never have to worry about a runaway board! Although the remote shouldnt ever disconnect, in the event that is does, E-STOP will ensure that your board will slow down, instead of allowing the reciever to "lock open" at full throttle.
- Priority Transmission Handling- The remote will deactivate display refresh and UART pull if no valid transmission is received and prioritise transmission handling to ensure you remain in control!
- 3 Riding Modes- No matter if you're a Beginner, Intermediate, or Pro, the Feather Remote has got your back and will allow you to tame your board to your liking.
- Police Mode- Allows you to easily and secretly tame the power of your board...for whatever reason you may need
- Multifunction Trigger- Can be used as a Deadman switch, or to set Cruise Control!
